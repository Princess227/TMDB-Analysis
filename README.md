## by Princess Obazee


## Dataset

>The dataset contains information about over 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). It is a collection of movies released between 1960 and 2015 with varying information such as the movie names, the popularity of the movie, budget, revenue, cast, director, release year, and other information that will be used to gather insights.



## Summary of Findings

>The Noughties and Teenies which is between the year 2000 and the year 2015 have the highest number of movies released. In the past decades there has been a tremendous increase in the number of movies released every year from 1960 to 2015. The year 2014 had the highest number of movies released with 700 movies and 1960 had the lowest number of movies released. The month of **September** has the highest number of movie release followed by the month of October. After examining the number of movies released each year, I analyzed whether the `release_year` of a movie is a determining factor in the `popularity` of a movie. Based on my findings, there is no correlation between these two values.

>The most common genre of movies are **Drama**, **Comedy**, **Thriller**, **Action** and **Romance**. The top 5 most featured actors in a movie are Robert De Niro, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Nicholas Cage and Michael Caine. The top directors with the highest number of movies released are Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, and Steven Spielberg. The major production companies with the highest number of movies produced are Universal Pictures, Warner Bros., and Paramount Pictures. The most popular movies based on popularity are Jurassic World, Mad Max: Fury Road and Interstellar. The month of June and November has the highest number of popular movies released. Inception, The Avengers, Avatar, and The Dark Knight are the most voted movies by highest number of vote count. Movies with the highest number of vote count are usually over two hours long in runtime but lesser than three hours thirty minutes. While movies with over three hours thirty minutes in runtime tend to have the least number of votes. 

>The year 2015 generated the highest profit. In the year 2000, the amount budgeted for movies was greater than the profit generated. The months June, December and May are the most profitable months to release movies.
